Architecture Decision Records,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>We need to record the architectural decisions made on this product. We will use Architecture Decision Records, as <a href=""https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions"">described by Michael Nygard</a>.</p>"
Terraform,Adopt,Technologies,FALSE,<p><Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files. We need to try it out if works good for our infrastracture as a code needs.</p>
Open Telemetry,Trial,Technologies,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://opentelemetry.io/"">OpenTelemetry</a> is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. You use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for analysis in order to understand your software's performance and behavior.</p>"
Grafana,Assess,Technologies,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://grafana.com/"">Grafana</a> has become the world’s most popular technology used to compose observability dashboards with everything from Prometheus & Graphite metrics, to logs and application data to power plants and beehives.</p>"
Kiali,Hold,Technologies,FALSE,"<p>Given the increased use of <a href=""/radar/techniques/service-mesh"">service mesh</a> to deploy collections of containerized microservices, we can expect to see tools emerge that automate and simplify the administrative tasks associated with this architectural style. <strong><a href=""https://kiali.io/"">Kiali</a></strong> is one such tool. Kiali provides a graphical user interface to observe and control networks of services deployed with <a href=""/radar/platforms/istio"">Istio</a>. We've found Kiali useful for visualizing the topology of services in a network and understanding the traffic routed between them. For example, when used in conjunction with <a href=""/radar/tools/flagger"">Flagger</a>, Kiali can display requests that have been routed to a canary service release. We particularly like Kiali's ability to artificially inject network faults into a service mesh to test resilience in the face of network interruptions. This practice is all too often ignored due to the complexity of configuring and running failure tests in a complex mesh of microservices.</p>"
Data mesh,Hold,Techniques,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html"">Data mesh</a></strong> marks a welcome architectural and organizational paradigm shift in how we manage big analytical data. The paradigm is founded on four principles: (1) domain-oriented decentralization of data ownership and architecture; (2) domain-oriented data served as a product; (3) self-serve data infrastructure as a platform to enable autonomous, domain-oriented data teams; and (4) federated governance to enable ecosystems and interoperability. Although the principles are intuitive and attempt to address many of the known challenges of previous centralized analytical data management, they transcend the available analytical data technologies. After building data mesh for multiple clients on top of the existing tooling, we learned two things: (a) there is a large gap in open-source or commercial tooling to accelerate implementation of data mesh (for example, implementation of a universal access model to time-based polyglot data which we currently custom build for our clients) and (b) despite the gap, it's feasible to use the existing technologies as the basic building blocks.</p>

<p>Naturally, technology fit is a major component of implementing your organization's data strategy based on data mesh. Success, however, demands an organizational restructure to separate the data platform team, create the role of data product owner for each domain and introduce the incentive structures necessary for domains to own and share their analytical data as products.</p>"
Zero trust architecture,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>While the fabric of computing and data continues to shift in enterprises — from monolithic applications to <a href=""/radar/techniques/microservices"">microservices</a>, from centralized data lakes to <a href=""/radar/techniques/data-mesh"">data mesh</a>, from on-prem hosting to polycloud, with an increasing proliferation of connected devices — the approach to securing enterprise assets for the most part remains unchanged, with heavy reliance and trust in the network perimeter: Organizations continue to make heavy investments to secure their assets by hardening the virtual walls of their enterprises, using private links and firewall configurations and replacing static and cumbersome security processes that no longer serve the reality of today. This continuing trend compelled us to highlight <strong>zero trust architecture</strong> (ZTA) again.</p>

<p>ZTA is a paradigm shift in security architecture and strategy. It’s based on the assumption that a network perimeter is no longer representative of a secure boundary and no implicit trust should be granted to users or services based solely on their physical or network location. The number of resources, tools and platforms available to implement aspects of ZTA keeps growing and includes: enforcing <a href=""/radar/techniques/security-policy-as-code"">policies as code</a> based on the least privilege and as granular as possible principles and continuous monitoring and automated mitigation of threats; using <a href=""/radar/techniques/service-mesh"">service mesh</a> to enforce security control application-to-service and service-to-service; implementing <a href=""/radar/techniques/binary-attestation"">binary attestation</a> to verify the origin of the binaries; and including <a href=""/radar/techniques/secure-enclaves"">secure enclaves</a> in addition to traditional encryption to enforce the three pillars of data security: in transit, at rest and in memory. For introductions to the topic, consult the <a href=""https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final"">NIST ZTA</a> publication and Google's white paper on <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/security/beyondprod"">BeyondProd</a>.</p>"
Micro frontend,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p> <a href=""/radar/techniques/micro-frontends"">Micro frontends</a> have grown in popularity and achieved mainstream acceptance. But like any new technique with an easy-to-remember name, it has occasionally been misused and abused. Particularly concerning is the tendency to use this architecture as an excuse to mix a range of competing technologies, tools or frameworks in a single page, leading to <strong>micro frontend anarchy</strong>. A particularly egregious form of this syndrome is using multiple frontend frameworks — for example, <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js"">React.js</a> and <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/angular"">Angular</a> — in the same ""single-page"" application. Although this might be technically possible, it is far from advisable when not part of a deliberate transition strategy. Other properties that should be consistent from team to team include the styling technique (e.g., <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/css-in-js"">CSS-in-JS</a> or <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/css-modules"">CSS modules</a>) and the means by which the individual components are integrated (e.g., iFrames or <a href=""/radar/platforms/web-components-standard"">web components</a>). Furthermore, organizations should decide whether to standardize on consistent approaches or to leave it up to their teams to decide on state management, data fetching, build tooling, analytics and a host of other choices in a micro frontend application.</p>"
Azure DevOps,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/"">Azure DevOps</a></strong> services contain a set of managed services, including hosted Git repos, CI/CD pipelines, automated testing tooling, backlog management tooling and artifact repository. We've seen our teams getting more experience in using this platform with good results, which means Azure DevOps is maturing. We particularly like its flexibility; it allows you to use the services you want even if they're from different providers. For instance, you could use an external Git repository while still using the Azure DevOps pipeline services. Our teams are especially excited about <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/"">Azure DevOps Pipelines</a>. Nevertheless, all the services offer a good developer experience that helps our teams deliver value.</p>"
Helm,Adopt,Technologies,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""http://helm.sh/"">Helm</a></strong> is a package manager for <a href=""/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a>. It comes with a repository of curated Kubernetes applications that are maintained in the official <a href=""https://github.com/helm/charts"">Charts repository</a>. Since we last talked about Helm, Helm 3 has been released, and the most significant change is the removal of Tiller, the server-side component of Helm 2. The benefit of a design without Tiller is that you can only make changes to the Kubernetes cluster from the client side, that is, you can only modify the cluster according to the permissions you have as a user of the Helm command. We've used Helm in a number of client projects and its dependency management, templating and hook mechanism has greatly simplified the application lifecycle management in Kubernetes.</p>"
Kustomize,Hold,Technologies,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://kustomize.io/"">Kustomize</a></strong> is a tool to manage and customize Kubernetes manifest files. It allows you to select and patch your base Kubernetes resources before applying them to different environments and is now natively supported by <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/"">kubectl</a>. We like it because it helps keep your code <a href=""https://wiki.c2.com/?DontRepeatYourself"">DRY</a> and in contrast to <a href=""/radar/tools/helm"">Helm</a> (which is trying to do many things — package management, version management and so on), we find Kustomize follows the Unix philosophy: do one thing well and expect the output of every program to be input to another.</p>"
tfsec,Adopt,Technologies,FALSE,"<p>Security is everyone's concern, and capturing risks early is always better than facing problems later on. In the <a href=""/radar/techniques/infrastructure-as-code"">infrastructure as code</a> space — where <a href=""/radar/tools/terraform"">Terraform</a> has been an obvious choice to manage cloud environments — we now also have <strong><a href=""https://github.com/liamg/tfsec"">tfsec</a></strong>, a static analysis tool that scans Terraform templates to find potential security issues. Our teams have been using tfsec quite successfully. The tool is easy to set up and use, which makes it a great choice for any development team determined to mitigate security risks to prevent breaches before they happen. Its preset rules for different cloud providers, including <a href=""/radar/platforms/aws"">AWS</a> and <a href=""/radar/platforms/azure"">Azure</a>, compliment the benefits that tfsec brings to the teams that use Terraform.</p>"
Yarn,Adopt,Technologies,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://yarnpkg.com/"">Yarn</a></strong> continues to be the package manager of choice for many teams. We're excited about Yarn 2, a major new release with a long list of changes and improvements. In addition to usability tweaks and improvements in the area of workspaces, Yarn 2 introduces the concept of <em>zero-installs</em>, which allows developers to run a project directly after cloning it. However, Yarn 2 includes some breaking changes which makes the upgrade <a href=""https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/migration"">nontrivial</a>. It also defaults to <a href=""https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/pnp/"">plug'n'play</a> (PnP) environments and at the same time doesn't support React Native in PnP environments. Teams can, of course, opt out of PnP or stay on Yarn 1. They should be aware, though, that Yarn 1 is now in maintenance mode.</p>"
Elastic Search,Assess,Technologies,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://www.elastic.co/"">Elastic Search</a> is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.</p>"
Prometheus,Adopt,Technologies,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://prometheus.io/"">Prometheus</a> is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company. To emphasize this, and to clarify the project's governance structure, Prometheus joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2016 as the second hosted project, after Kubernetes.</p>"
